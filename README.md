# Mission-to-Mars
This project is to establish and build our ability to webscrape and begin compiling in HTML.

## Deliverables
1.  Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.
2.  Update the Mongo database and modify the index.html file so that the built webpage would contain all current and new information compiled in addition to the new images and titles.
3.  Update the web app to make it mobile responsie, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.

### Challenges
This was by far the hardest module to complete to date for me at this time.  Some of the bigger struggles was in getting the coding to identify and record the URL for the images.  Additionally I ran into issues with modifying the web pages.  Through reading information at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/colors/) and consulting with other programmers I was able to make headway and deliver the module.
